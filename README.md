# 👋 Hi, I'm Cory — Systems Thinker, Workflow Architect, and Developer in Progress

I build clean, modular, reproducible systems — whether it's code, automation tools, modding workflows, or real‑world processes.  
My background blends **technical problem‑solving**, **forensic debugging**, and **architecture‑level thinking**, and I'm now channeling that into software development and freelance automation work.

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On Right Now
- Building a **freelance‑ready toolkit** for automation, scripting, and small web apps  
- Learning Python with an emphasis on **real‑world problem solving**  
- Designing tools that reduce friction, eliminate drift, and make workflows reproducible  
- Mapping a long‑term CS pathway that aligns with my systems‑thinking mindset  

---

## 🔧 Technical Interests
- Python scripting & automation  
- API tools and data pipelines  
- Small Flask/FastAPI web apps  
- File organization utilities  
- JSON/YAML manipulation  
- Modding tools and game workflow automation

## 🗂️ Current & Upcoming Projects
### 🚀 Smart File Organizer (Python)
A rules‑based file sorting tool designed for clarity, reproducibility, and zero drift.

### 🔄 API Automation Tool
Pulling structured data from APIs and transforming it into useful outputs.

### 📊 Simple Web Dashboard (Flask)
A lightweight dashboard for displaying data or automating small tasks.

## 🧱 How I Work
- **Modular architecture** — everything broken into clean, reusable components  
- **Structured reasoning** — clarity first, chaos never  
- **Reproducible workflows** — no “mystery steps,” no hidden state  
- **Audit‑friendly** — every project documented, every decision intentional
