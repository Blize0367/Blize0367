## 🧰 Tech stack

**Languages & runtimes**

- **Python:** API backends, scripting, workflow automation  
- **YAML:** Configuration as contract, structured workflows  

**Tools & environments**

- **VS Code:** Primary editor, workspace and task orchestration  
- **Postman:** API design, testing, and documentation  
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control, collaboration, and deployment

---

## 🧩 What I build

- **APIs and backends:**  
  Flask/FastAPI-style services focused on clarity, structure, and easy extension.

- **Reproducible workflows:**  
  YAML-based configs and scripts that remove guesswork and make behavior repeatable.

- **Testing & validation layers:**  
  Postman collections and basic automation that keep changes safe and intentional.

- **Developer environments:**  
  VS Code workspaces, recommended extensions, and settings to get from zero to productive fast.

## 💼 Freelance offerings

I like turning messy processes into clean, modular systems.

- **API development:**  
  Design and implement small to mid-sized APIs (authentication, routing, basic business logic).

- **YAML configuration design:**  
  Structure configs for apps, services, and workflows so they’re readable and maintainable.

- **Postman test suites:**  
  Collections that document and validate your API behavior.

- **VS Code environment setup:**  
  Settings, tasks, and extensions tailored to your project or team.

- **Architecture & debug audits:**  
  Review existing projects for structure, clarity, and consistency; suggest and implement refactors.

## 🔄 How I think about systems

- **Reproducibility first:**  
  If it can’t be run twice with the same result, it isn’t done yet.

- **Configs as contracts:**  
  YAML and settings are living agreements between people and machines.

- **No drift:**  
  I prefer explicit decisions over “it just kind of evolved this way.”

- **Small, composable pieces:**  
  I’d rather ship a clean, well-defined module than a tangled “big thing.”
