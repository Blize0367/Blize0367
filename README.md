## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

**Languages & Configs**
- Python (learning through hands‑on API and workflow projects)
- YAML (learning through real configuration and automation patterns)

**Tools**
- VS Code — my primary workspace
- Postman — API testing, documentation, and exploration
- Git & GitHub — version control, structure, and collaboration

## 🌱 Currently Learning
> **Growing my skills in Python and YAML through hands‑on projects, workflow design, and API experimentation.**

This keeps my work grounded, honest, and always moving forward.

---

## 🧩 What I Build

- **APIs & backend structures**  
  Small, clean services built with clarity and reproducibility in mind.

- **Workflow systems**  
  YAML‑driven configs that remove guesswork and make behavior predictable.

- **Testing layers**  
  Postman collections that validate API behavior and document endpoints.

- **Developer environments**  
  VS Code setups that get from zero to productive with minimal friction.

## 💼 Freelance Offerings

I help people turn messy processes into clean, modular systems.

- API development (Flask/FastAPI style)
- YAML configuration design
- Workflow automation
- Postman test suite creation
- VS Code environment setup
- Architecture & debugging audits

## 🔄 How I Think About Systems

- **Reproducibility first** — if it can’t be run twice with the same result, it isn’t done.  
- **Configs as contracts** — YAML and settings define behavior clearly and explicitly.  
- **No drift** — intentional decisions over accidental evolution.  
- **Small, composable modules** — clarity beats complexity every time.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

- API starter templates  
- YAML workflow patterns  
- Postman collections  
- VS Code workspace setups  
- Experiments in making complex work feel calm and predictable
